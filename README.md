# Space Shooter - Nebula Attack ðŸŽ®
I made the Space Shooter unity tutorial game BUT BETTER! The Mobile version was not that great, so I remade it. Spaceship control now is top notch.
This is an old project, made back when I was interested in Unity. It should work with all android versions, even if there's a warning about old versions.
It's not the best game ever ofc, but it's a good entertainment for when you're on the toilet.
